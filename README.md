# LETS PLANNING

## Tech Stack

- Front-end: html, javascript, css
- Back-end: nodejs

It's a monolith application, which returns a page based on the requested address.


## Running

There's two ways to run this application:
- 1 - Just Run the build-run script. Run the following code like: sh ./build-run.sh
- 2 - Once you have docker-compose installed, just run: docker-compose -d --build up

Observations:
- 1: For both, you must have docker installed.
- 2: Using docker-compose will also run a MySql Container
